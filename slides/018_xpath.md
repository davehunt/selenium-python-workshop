# XPath
There are some situations where CSS selectors can't locate the desired element. In those cases you could try to write an XPath locator, however be careful not to use anything too brittle. You should also explore the possibility of modifying the application to make it easier to locate your target element.

## Exercise
Convert the CSS selectors into XPath.
